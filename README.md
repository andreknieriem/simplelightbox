### Install
```sh
// YARN
yarn add simplelightbox

// Bower
bower install simplelightbox

// NPM
npm install simplelightbox
```

After that include simple-lightbox(.min).css and simple-lightbox(.min).js to your page.

### Usage
#### Standalone Plugin
When using the standalone variant (`simple-lightbox(.min).js`)
```javascript
new SimpleLightbox('.some-element a', { /* options */ });
```

The jQuery-compatible (`simple-lightbox.jquery(.min).js`) variant works as before (v1.x):
```javascript
$('.some-element a').simpleLightbox({ /* options */ });
```

#### With Webpack/Browserify/Parcel etc...
Choose the module file you want to import or require.

**Module with Babel tranformation**
```javascript
import SimpleLightbox from "simplelightbox";
```

**Plain ES Module without Babel**
```javascript
import SimpleLightbox from "simplelightbox/dist/simple-lightbox.esm"
```

### Markup
For the default setup, you just need links that are pointing to images.

```markup
<div class="gallery">
    <a href="images/image1.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/thumb1.jpg" alt="" title=""/></a>
    <a href="images/image2.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/thumb2.jpg" alt="" title="Beautiful Image"/></a>
</div>
```

The markup inside the A-Tags can be whatever you want. In this example thumbnails of the big images. The 'title' tag is used by default to show a caption.
For a complete example just look at the demo folder.

This option can be used as an anchor rel alternative for Simplelightbox. It allows the user to group any combination of elements together for a gallery, or to override an existing rel so elements are not grouped together.
